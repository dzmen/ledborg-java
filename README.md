ledborg-java
============

Little java project for raspberry pi add-on ledborg (http://piborg.org/ledborg) :)

I am still not very good in java, but I will try my best. Did you find a bug or do you have a suggestion to make this 
application better? Please let me know. The best way is by twitter :). https://twitter.com/dannywillem
